# Mobile_app_Practice-Always-Safe-Sex
This is my very first experience in mobile application development. My team and I did everything from mobile app designing to write the code. The app Practice Always Safe Sex(PASS) provides users specific STD information based on the choice of partnerâ€™s gender, the type of sexual intercourse and symptoms. Current version targets to female. So if you are a female and own an android phone, congratulations! You can start to download and install the apk file and use it to protect yourself. Of course, anyone who is interested in this app is more than welcomed to explore. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback!
